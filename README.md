## About

This repository is a step-by-step guide to learning WebGPU.
It begins with rendering a simple triangle and gradually progresses to more advanced WebGPU concepts, helping beginners understand WebGPU from the ground up.

In this repository, you will learn WebGPU by building examples on your own:

- Basic WebGPU configuration and setup
- Writing shader code (WGSL)
- Creating render pipelines
- Rendering graphics to the canvas

Each step focuses on one concept at a time to make learning easier and clearer.

## Getting Started
