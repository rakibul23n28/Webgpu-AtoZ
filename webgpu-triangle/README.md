## About

This repository is a step-by-step guide to learning **WebGPU**.
It starts with rendering a simple triangle and gradually moves toward more advanced WebGPU concepts, helping beginners understand WebGPU from the ground up.

You can learn WebGPU by building things yourself. In this project, you will explore:

- Basic WebGPU configuration and setup
- Writing shader code using WGSL
- Creating render pipelines
- Running the render loop and drawing to a canvas

Each example focuses on clarity and simplicity rather than abstraction.
